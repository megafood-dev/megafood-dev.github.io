## Markup
The hint ID must begin with the text `hint-`.

If there is also an error message associated with the input, it should appear above the hint text.

## Accessibility
Be sure to include the `aria-describedby` attribute that points to the ID of the associated hint message.

If this component is used on the page more than once, the IDs must be unique.
