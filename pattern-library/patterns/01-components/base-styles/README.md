## Purpose
The purpose of this component is to provide appropriate base styles to any elements in this container because the site doesn't have base styles yet. This allows content assets, for example, to have appropriate styles without inline CSS. This is a temporary component that can be removed once we've added base styles.

Another example of this can be seen in the Subscription FAQ component.
