## Purpose
This component exists to house styles for all of the sliders. The JS only serves as an example of how the slider works and is only used in pattern-lib.js, which means it should not be included in megafood.js.

The `.pl-slider` class exists to ensure the JS doesn't conflict with other `.slider` classes in use, since this JS is only loading in the PL.
