## Markup
`<header>` or `<section>` can be used for this component's container, depending on how it needs to be used on a page.

Any markup can be used inside of this component. There are styles applied to `h1`, but that heading level is not required for this component since this component could be used as a section in a different hierarchical level. The `h1` can be changed to a `p` if the `.header` class is applied to it, which will preserve the `h1` styles. This is useful for pages where a header isn't appropriate, such as a podcast episode page.

The `.eyebrow` class can be used to make a header look more like a paragraph.
