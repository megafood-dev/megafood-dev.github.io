## Purpose
The Generic template is the default template, and all other templates inherit styles from this one. It only uses the styles globally applied to the `<main>` element and doesn't have any styles of its own. It has been included here to show that it is an option to use the base styles on `main` as a template.

## Examples
This template is currently being used in the following places:
* HP
* PDP
* Reviews
* Process
* Podcast
* Probiotic Landing
* Energy Landing
* Gummy Landing
